    <h3>Browser cache is images, media files scripts and files stored on devices
      by the websites. It is like a temp folder(memory) of the website and the next time
      you can access this website faster because it doesn't need to get to the
      web server and re-download the same files again. The reason why clearing your
      cookies resets the MailChimp form is because your devices remember you've
      did something in the last time you were on this website, like closed the popup
      or already subscribed, your devices know you alreay made your choices and
      they won't ask again. When you clear the cookies and site data, it is like
      you reset the memory of this website so your popup shows again.
